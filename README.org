* About

rpm-tool is yet another tool to work with RPM files and RPM repositories. Key features:
 - Fast repository index generator (yes, faster than createrepo and even createrepo_c)
 - Provide RPM files metadata in easy to parse formats: YAML, JSON and XML

* What to be done

 - Support for other.xml.gz repodata
 - Support for modules repositories index (new feature in Centos 8)

Note that *.sqlite.gz formats of repodata are deprecated since 2015 and will not supported by utility.

* Usage

** Configuration file

Currently configuration file is minimalistic and self-documented.

** Command line options

All command line options are well self-documented. Below just few examples with comments:

*** Get help

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rpm-tool help
rpm-tool rpm help
rpm-tool repository help
#+END_SRC


*** Show information about RPM package in JSON format

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rpm-tool rpm dump -f json /path/to/file.rpm
#+END_SRC

*** Generate repository index with fileslists

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rpm-tool repository generate --fileslists /path/to/repository/directory/
#+END_SRC

Tool use already existing repodata to safely skip heavy operations like calculating checksums or even reading RPM file headers,

To effectively utilize CPU usage rpm-tool creates threads pool, which is used to calculate checksums, read RPM headers, gzip resulting
metadata and so on. Pool size can be configured via config file, see repodataâ†’concurrency.

** Log to console

Tool can write log to STDOUT instead of syslog. Just define environment variable RUST_LOG with disired log level:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
RUST_LOG=info rpm-tool repository generate ...
#+END_SRC
